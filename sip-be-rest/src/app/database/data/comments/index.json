If you own an NFT, wouldn't you want to know its worth?\n\nBuying is easy, figuring out how much to sell your NFT for is hard. Otherwise, you'll end up listing it for the floor price. üòï\n\nWhile ‚ÄòNFT tracking‚Äô tools exist, they often show you only the floor price of an NFT. ü§î\n\nIntroducing Asset.Money üö® - A platform where you can manage your NFTs and estimate their worth based on rarity, traits, and much more.\n\nThings you can do :\n\nPortfolio: You can track your entire NFT portfolio on the ERC chain.\n\nShowcase: You can connect your Sol and Tezos wallet, and see all your NFTs from Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, and Tezos in one place.\n\nCurrently, this acts as a showcase to share with your friends. Bringing in NFT data like traits, rarity, and estimated values for Polygon, SOL, and Tezos is on our roadmap.\n\nDo share your feedback and if you like it - Hit that 'Tweet' button on the dashboard and spread the word Ôªø\nüôÇ\n\nHave questions, feedback, ideas, suggestions? Hop over and say Hi! üëãüèª\n\n(Want to know how we are estimating the value of every NFT and the mechanics behind it?

Perhaps not. Is it impactful? We think so! Here's to more building, and less of whatever \"Ops\" is! ;-)",

We are sharing snippet-based authentication solutions for websites.  ‚ú®\n\n‚≠êÔ∏è Rownd Auth ‚Äì Frictionless authentication and profile management for any website or webapp with a snippet.   We are making this in the open and would love feedback.  \n\n\nThe Problem: \nAuthentication is still largely focused on the application and creates a divide across marketing sites (blogs, landing pages, docs) and the actual webapp where the cool stuff happens.  This divide adds needless friction.\n\n== What does Rownd do?  ==\nüè†The Rownd Hub (a small widget) is your website‚Äôs authentication and profile tab.  We give end-users a simple way to see their status, what data has been collected, and control over the data.  \n\n\n‚ö°Ô∏è One snippet for websites and an easy SDK for webapps (mobile app support coming soon).  \n\n‚úÖ Any site.  We work on webflow, wordpress, Jamstack sites fronted by Netlify, custom sites or you can add us to any site you can proxy through cloudflare.  \n\nüåâ Across sites. We can work across your websites. If you have a blog in wordpress and a landing page on webflow, auth will follow the user. \n\nüó∫Ô∏è User profiles can be created over time across sites and the data is available to the browser for fast customizations and personalizations.\n\n‚ö°Ô∏è No more ‚Äúsign up‚Äù page, get your users into your app faster, let them try what you show them on your marketing pages.\n\nüéä  Privacy first - CCPA and GDPR ready\n\nWhy us?\nWe are a bunch of makers who just got sick of the current auth solutions on the market. They either take too long to set up or they offload profile/PII responsibility back to the developer.  We wanted an all in one solution that we could use for our projects.  \n\nWe all come from large IT companies where we did data authentication for some of the largest companies in the US and Europe.  We wanted to take that passion for data security and safety and bring it to the rest of the world.  \n\nWhat to expect\nEverything is snippet based.  We are working on some no-code tools to help set up the auth, but right now you have to modify the actual snippet. We show you how to add auth to any page, how to customize a page based on profile data, and how to send form data to Rownd.   \n\nGive us some feedback!\nPlease give it a whirl.  We built our onboarding tool in webflow to show you the power of our new auth.  Give it a try!   https://rowndauth.com/producthunt.  We are free for 14 days and then 50% off for the next year if you try us today!  No credit card needed.  We would LOVE feedback.",

I made it because I'm passionate about giving power to people to be able to create their own highly-customised workflows that make them more productive without needing to write a single line of code.\n\nI absolutely love Notion - it's one of the most flexible ways for storing and visualising data, which makes it a match made in heaven when paired with Shortcuts - the most intuitive no-code automation tool.\n\nI've seen some really creative uses for it so far, some of my favourites:\n\n‚Ä¢ Creating an inventory system using your iPhone as a barcode scanner with Notion as the database backend\n‚Ä¢ Personal watch later list, with movies and TV shows being stored with rich metadata\n‚Ä¢ Adding new contacts into a CRM using Siri\n‚Ä¢ Creating an automatic journalling system which pulls in music listened to that day, workout info, weather etc to create rich Notion pages\n\nSome of these I've made into example Shortcuts you can find in the app right now and there'll be lots more I'll be adding in the coming days!\n\nShout if you have any questions ‚úåüèª",

Leading a small team of designers across multiple time zones, I don‚Äôt want to enforce stand-ups where teams are required to join a call daily. I want the team to be able to focus without interruption but be able to raise questions or concerns in a dedicated space when they need to.\n\nAfter using Stand for about 4 weeks, it feels great! It hasn‚Äôt completely removed the need for calls (and I didn‚Äôt expect that it would), but it has definitely reduced them and given me a better understanding of what the team are working on, removing blockers and most importantly, how the team are feeling day to day.\n\nüöÄ How long did it take to build?\nAround 4 months in total to launch the current MVP here on Product Hunt. This is outside of my busy 9 to 5 role, working across evenings and weekends. I wanted to release an MVP at around the 2 month mark, but overall I am happy with the time it has taken me to design and build Stand from scratch.\n\nüî• Some key features:\nAsynchronous stand-ups for your team!\nYour team will be reminded to attend the stand-up on the day and time of their choosing (although team admins can also request a time to attend).\nAll stand-ups have discussions/comments allowing your team to communicate directly and efficiently.\nMood tracking - every team member will be asked how they feel during the stand-up.\nInsights - see at a glance your team‚Äôs performance, blockers, questions and moods.\nBuilt with remote teams in mind.\nLess time on Zoom or Slack calls.\nHappier team members!\n\nü•≥ 50% off for the Product Hunt community\nUse the promo code ProductHunt50 when purchasing a plan to get 50% off the price of a plan forever!\n\nIf you have any feedback, I would love to hear it!",

The result is The Modern Billboard Collective ‚Äì the first experiment in tokenized advertising where you can buy ad space represented as NFTs that are freely tradable. \n\nIf you believe any of our websites will succeed and more people will want to visit it in the future, you can buy a little piece of it now - represented as an NFT on a billboard -  and resell it in the future for a likely profit. As a lot owner, you can upload an image + link out to a URL of your choice. \n\nWant to promote your company or project?

Together with Samuel Holder, we‚Äôve built a browser-extension that recommends product specific sustainable alternatives as you shop online. This is just a BETA and we‚Äôre looking for any and all feedback!\n\nWhy we built Ango\n\nWe built Ango to make sustainable shopping more convenient for consumers as they shop online. We found that consumers face two issues as they shop online:\n\nTruly sustainable products are difficult to verify without in depth knowledge, greenwashing makes this incredibly arduous. \nSustainable alternatives are far too expensive, we found that on average, they‚Äôre 100-200% more expensive. This is a huge barrier for the majority of consumers.\n\nWe want to help accelerate that transition to a more sustainable lifestyle and economy. Making sustainable, attainable.\n\n\nKey features of Ango\n\n\nüëå Recommendations: Ango will recommend to you sustainable alternatives as you shop online. E.g., If you shopping on Next for a t-shirt, ango would simply pop up and show you the closest matching sustainable variant. \n\nüîé Search: We have input basic search functionality, this will be improved at a later stage!\n\nüí∞ Discounts: With some of our partners, we have negotiated some exclusive discounts on sustainable products.\n\n‚òù Try us out on Chrome and Microsoft Edge\n\nGive us a try and please let us know what you think. It is only operational on Next, BooHoo and H&M with a relatively high degree of coverage and accuracy. We are very interested in feedback (good & bad) to make sure we continue to improve Ango in the right direction üôÇ\n",

I'm thrilled to announce my first chrome-based extension Type2Learn with you all. I had always enjoyed practicing touch typing and racing with my friends online. Hitting two birds with one stone, I created this extension to practice touch typing and concentrate on your webpage.\n\nSteps to use the extension:\n1) Select a paragraph by clicking on it or selecting any word from it\n2) Click on the extension icon in the toolbar. A popup will appear.\n3) Click on the button - Prepare Text. You should see the first letter of the paragraph highlighted.\n4) Start typing from the beginning of the selected paragraph.\n\nPS: this extension version currently works on the pages in which the text selected is in paragraph HTML tag\n\nHere's the source code if anyone is interested. Feel free to contribute to it.\nhttps://github.com/rghv96/type2learn",
