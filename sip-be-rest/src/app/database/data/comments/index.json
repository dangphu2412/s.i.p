My parents are now in a basement waiting for another air attack. It is not a minor conflict as your media might be saying. It is a war.\n\nI know we've been on Product Hunt with a few products to support Ukraine nowadays and I don't want to spam you, but I feel like for us Product Hunt is one of the platforms that allows to grow international awareness. \n\nHunters, we've built this widget so you could easily support Ukrainians nowadays. It is a simple piece of code that would show our widget on your website and make your visitors aware of how they can support. \n\nThanks. Glory to Ukraine!",

Where there are multiple sessions, by multiple users, on multiple devices, over a period of months.\n\nDreamdata is able to do this because our platform connects the whole go-to-market ecosystem, to track every session by every user of every account; revealing the end-to-end B2B customer journey.\n\nIf you have any questions or feedback about Content Analytics, or how we collect and model our data, I‚Äôm here to help! üòÄ",

We wanted to make it as easy, fast, and simple as possible to  configure, launch and manage a personalized and flexible DevOps toolchain, so we built DevStream as an open source product to do exactly that. \n\nMonolithic DevOps platforms don't fit most agile teams, One-Size-Fits-All == One-Size-Fits-None. \n\nDevStream lets you choose the pieces you want, and build your own personalized DevOps platform with none of the operational overhead.\n\nIf you're just starting up, DevStream makes it easy to get the right products, processes, connections, and automations in place to scale great engineering. \n\nIf you're already established, DevStream equips you to freshen up and enhance the interoperability of your process. \n\nIs it sexy? Perhaps not. Is it impactful? We think so! Here's to more building, and less of whatever \"Ops\" is! ;-)",

Which brings me to why we‚Äôre all here ü•Åü•Å\n\nTo share a gallery of proven sales & onboarding playbooks, curated from the world's top startups and sales/success leaders (Figma, Productboard, YC startups, etc, etc)! üôÄ \n\nWe heard from founders: \"I'm not a sales / onboarding expert, how do I build a repeatable, collaborative experience for my customers and hit scaling revenue goals??\" \"I don't want to start from scratch\"\n\nAnd startup sales leaders: \"I need everyone on my team selling like our best rep (proactive, engaging, transparent), how do I align them around our playbook and drive consistency?\" \"How are others doing this?\"\n\nYou can now access all of these insights & winning processes, distilled into easy to use playbooks, for free.\n\nSpanning multiple use cases (from sales-led to PLG, and POCs to implementation), and for companies from Seed to hyper growth scale. Whether you‚Äôre looking for customer onboarding guides, mutual action plans, or rep training checklists, we‚Äôve got something for you!\n\nHave a playbook you‚Äôd like to contribute or see added? Email us and let‚Äôs make the world of B2B sales a better place for buyers & sellers :)\n\nLooking forward to thoughtful feedback, comments, and constructive criticism ü§†",

Thanks @chrismessina for the hunt üôèüèª\n\nNautoamate is my second app after <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/posts/toolbox-pro\">Toolbox Pro</a> . I made it because I'm passionate about giving power to people to be able to create their own highly-customised workflows that make them more productive without needing to write a single line of code.\n\nI absolutely love Notion - it's one of the most flexible ways for storing and visualising data, which makes it a match made in heaven when paired with Shortcuts - the most intuitive no-code automation tool.\n\nI've seen some really creative uses for it so far, some of my favourites:\n\n‚Ä¢ Creating an inventory system using your iPhone as a barcode scanner with Notion as the database backend\n‚Ä¢ Personal watch later list, with movies and TV shows being stored with rich metadata\n‚Ä¢ Adding new contacts into a CRM using Siri\n‚Ä¢ Creating an automatic journalling system which pulls in music listened to that day, workout info, weather etc to create rich Notion pages\n\nSome of these I've made into example Shortcuts you can find in the app right now and there'll be lots more I'll be adding in the coming days!\n\nShout if you have any questions ‚úåüèª",

After using their API for over a decade, I couldn‚Äôt believe it! My years of data would no longer be accessible. I snarkily tweeted that I should build an alternative book platform out of spite for Amazon. \n\nNine months, 5 co-founders, 80+ user interviews, and 100s of GB of book data later, we‚Äôre launching our beta and you‚Äôre all invited!\n\nüßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Who is Hardcover For\n\nReaders who are constantly on the hunt for new and exciting books. Whether you only read a few books per year or are plowing through dozens each month, no one wants to waste time on books they don‚Äôt love. Hardcover will help you find and keep track of what‚Äôs next on your reading list.\n\nAll of your activity on Hardcover can be public, private only to you, or shared with people you follow. Yes, you can be antisocial on our social network too‚Äîwhatever helps you to read more books.\n\nüêâ A Short Story\n\nMany of the readers we‚Äôve talked to have a similar process for finding new books to read. Tell us if this sounds like you or if it doesn‚Äôt.\n\nWhenever you hear about a new book that sparks your curiosity, you search for it. You read a little bit about that book from the top search result‚Äîeither on Amazon or Goodreads. Maybe you read a few reviews, or you make a choice to go in with a fresh mind.\n\nOnce you‚Äôre interested in a book the next thought is usually, ‚ÄúWhen do I read it?‚Äù As soon as possible or sometime down the line?\n\nMany readers need a place to keep track of those books‚Äîsomething they do today through Goodreads, in a Google Sheet, or in a bunch of other ways.\n\nAt Hardcover, we want to be that place you save all the books you want to read. When you‚Äôre ready to actively seek out new books to read, we‚Äôll show you what your friends are reading, popular lists, and our weekly polls. (ex: ‚ÄúWhat were your favorite childhood books?‚Äù) We also have many more things planned.\n\nWe hope you join Hardcover to track what you want to read and stay for the community and book discovery.\n\n\nüìö What You Can do on Hardcover\n\nTrack üìì what you want to read, what you‚Äôve read, and what you‚Äôre reading; including the option to track the date(s) you started and finished a book as well as which format (read or listened).\n\nConfidently üöö  move every book & list in your library from Goodreads to Hardcover.\n\nFollow your üë≠ friends and share what you‚Äôre reading with each other.\n\nGet a üì∞ feed of your friends‚Äô activities and activities for books you‚Äôre interested in.\n\nCreate book üèÜ goals‚Äîeither by the number of books or number of pages.\n\nOrganize your books into üìö lists and easily find what you‚Äôre looking for.\n\nSee üìä stats for lists (and more later) based on a wide variety of data.\n\nDiscover books through üìà popular lists, prompts, and social feed.\n\nüìò Join Hardcover Beta\n\nUse the invite code ‚Äúproducthunt‚Äù to activate your account today!

Leading a small team of designers across multiple time zones, I don‚Äôt want to enforce stand-ups where teams are required to join a call daily. I want the team to be able to focus without interruption but be able to raise questions or concerns in a dedicated space when they need to.\n\nAfter using Stand for about 4 weeks, it feels great! It hasn‚Äôt completely removed the need for calls (and I didn‚Äôt expect that it would), but it has definitely reduced them and given me a better understanding of what the team are working on, removing blockers and most importantly, how the team are feeling day to day.\n\nüöÄ How long did it take to build?\nAround 4 months in total to launch the current MVP here on Product Hunt. This is outside of my busy 9 to 5 role, working across evenings and weekends. I wanted to release an MVP at around the 2 month mark, but overall I am happy with the time it has taken me to design and build Stand from scratch.\n\nüî• Some key features:\nAsynchronous stand-ups for your team!\nYour team will be reminded to attend the stand-up on the day and time of their choosing (although team admins can also request a time to attend).\nAll stand-ups have discussions/comments allowing your team to communicate directly and efficiently.\nMood tracking - every team member will be asked how they feel during the stand-up.\nInsights - see at a glance your team‚Äôs performance, blockers, questions and moods.\nBuilt with remote teams in mind.\nLess time on Zoom or Slack calls.\nHappier team members!\n\nü•≥ 50% off for the Product Hunt community\nUse the promo code ProductHunt50 when purchasing a plan to get 50% off the price of a plan forever!\n\nIf you have any feedback, I would love to hear it!",

What if you could fund your startup while aligning your community with your upside? What would the Million Dollar Homepage look like, reimagined in a crypto-native way? \n\nA few Internet friends came together to reflect on these questions. The result is The Modern Billboard Collective ‚Äì the first experiment in tokenized advertising where you can buy ad space represented as NFTs that are freely tradable. \n\nIf you believe any of our websites will succeed and more people will want to visit it in the future, you can buy a little piece of it now - represented as an NFT on a billboard -  and resell it in the future for a likely profit. As a lot owner, you can upload an image + link out to a URL of your choice. \n\nWant to promote your company or project? Stick your logo in it.\nWant to show off your ape avatar and link to your twitter profile? Do your thing.\nWant to rent the ad space to someone else and make $?

Give a few different color backgrounds to choose from\n3. By twitter banner you mean Twitter cover image? If so it is 3:1 aspect ratio, but the image you generated isn't following that, please check that\n4. Resolution of the generated image is just too small, you can increase that\n5. Some profile images just pop out, which is not a good UX, adjust that\n6. Finally why have extra options to generate PNG, you could do that in the first attempt itself. \n\nThanks, have a nice day.

We are sharing snippet-based authentication solutions for websites.  ‚ú®\n\n‚≠êÔ∏è Rownd Auth ‚Äì Frictionless authentication and profile management for any website or webapp with a snippet.   We are making this in the open and would love feedback.  \n\n\nThe Problem: \nAuthentication is still largely focused on the application and creates a divide across marketing sites (blogs, landing pages, docs) and the actual webapp where the cool stuff happens.  This divide adds needless friction.\n\n== What does Rownd do?  ==\nüè†The Rownd Hub (a small widget) is your website‚Äôs authentication and profile tab.  We give end-users a simple way to see their status, what data has been collected, and control over the data.  \n\n\n‚ö°Ô∏è One snippet for websites and an easy SDK for webapps (mobile app support coming soon).  \n\n‚úÖ Any site.  We work on webflow, wordpress, Jamstack sites fronted by Netlify, custom sites or you can add us to any site you can proxy through cloudflare.  \n\nüåâ Across sites. We can work across your websites. If you have a blog in wordpress and a landing page on webflow, auth will follow the user. \n\nüó∫Ô∏è User profiles can be created over time across sites and the data is available to the browser for fast customizations and personalizations.\n\n‚ö°Ô∏è No more ‚Äúsign up‚Äù page, get your users into your app faster, let them try what you show them on your marketing pages.\n\nüéä  Privacy first - CCPA and GDPR ready\n\nWhy us?\nWe are a bunch of makers who just got sick of the current auth solutions on the market. They either take too long to set up or they offload profile/PII responsibility back to the developer.  We wanted an all in one solution that we could use for our projects.  \n\nWe all come from large IT companies where we did data authentication for some of the largest companies in the US and Europe.  We wanted to take that passion for data security and safety and bring it to the rest of the world.  \n\nWhat to expect\nEverything is snippet based.  We are working on some no-code tools to help set up the auth, but right now you have to modify the actual snippet. We show you how to add auth to any page, how to customize a page based on profile data, and how to send form data to Rownd.   \n\nGive us some feedback!\nPlease give it a whirl.  We built our onboarding tool in webflow to show you the power of our new auth.  Give it a try!   https://rowndauth.com/producthunt.  We are free for 14 days and then 50% off for the next year if you try us today!  No credit card needed.  We would LOVE feedback.",

I am a web developer by profession with several products and projects in the pipeline. Consequently, I was having a bad time managing my day to day tasks and the truth is that I was massively unorganized. Long story short, a friend of mine (kudos to @hamza_ahmad2) who was an expert Notion designer joined me and that's how TNT was born.\n\nI use Templates from this collection on a daily basis for my personal and professional projects. It has helped me and my team be more productive (maybe I am biased) but my team has nothing to do with TNT and they think the same. \n\nBecause Notion has helped me and my team drastically, I have decided to generalize the templates and make it available for people that are facing the same issues.\n\nTNT is totally free and has 14 expertly designed Templates for you to use.\n\nI hope you enjoy using TNT.",

However, until now startups have had to suffer through a terrible banking experience in order to access these debt products. Well, that time has changed.\n\nWhile employed at a bank my team had just won a Venture Debt deal with a company that was currently working with Mercury. When we told the founder that they would have to move all of the company‚Äôs deposits over in order to access the debt ‚Äì to say the least ‚Äì they were not happy and insisted that we allow them to keep Mercury as their primary. After realizing that there was no alternative, the founder reluctantly switched in order to access the capital they needed. This left a huge impression on me that founders and their teams expect more out of their financial partners and that this need is not currently being met.\nInsert Mercury Capital.\n\nAs a team we are working to build a suite of capital products and tools that can help founders fuel the growth of their businesses. We are doing this by building a tech-enabled lending platform that allows founders to access Mercury Capital products and pair them with other best-in-class capital products from our partners. There is so much opportunity ahead of us, but one thing is for sure ‚Äì expect to see the same type of quality from our Capital product that you now experience with Mercury. We can‚Äôt wait to learn more about your businesses and explore new ways we can help you grow.\n\nApply at mercury.com/venture-debt/apply\n\nWe'd love to know what you think!",

This is the spiritual successor to our Capital Guide project, and is our first proprietary financing option. The Capital team‚Äôs core philosophy is helping founders to access capital and identify the best cash flow options for their business. \nThe team started by focusing on educational materials, and a simple interface for connecting founders and financiers. We created a curated list of vetted partners that primarily funded ecommerce and Saas companies. As we looked into options for startups to extend their runway by stacking debt on top of a recent equity round, we found that the existing options weren‚Äôt up to our standards. Therefore, in line with Mercury‚Äôs broader mission of providing a best in class experience for founders, we decided to create our own offering. While it is still early days for this product, the most exciting part for me is that we are going to be able to collect founder feedback and action it immediately, because we have control of the user experience end to end!",

Especially for tasks like audio visualization and transcribing.\n\nThe goal of Vokal is to create a super simple system that can be used by those with less to no video editing skills. You start by uploading your audio or video file. Choose one of the ready-made templates and customize it or start from scratch.\n\nI have a list of ideas I want to implement related to audio visualization, check back every now and then for more awesomeness.\n\n‚≠êÔ∏è Key features\n\n- Animated sound waveforms\n- Time progress visualizers\n- Auto-generated subtitles in a boatload of languages\n- Pre-designer-made templates\n- Full-fledged editor to customize everything easily\n- GIF stickers and animations\n- Free stock videos and photos\n\nLet me know if you have any comments, suggestions, or feedback!

We‚Äôre excited to have Michael hunt this for us!\n\nTL;DR: SimpleHash allows web3 developers to query NFT data from a single API. We index multiple blockchains, take care of edge cases, and can be integrated in a few lines of code.\n\n** The API offers: **\n\n‚úÖ Querying NFTs by contract address, token id, or owner\n‚úÖ Getting the transaction history for wallets\n‚úÖ Getting the transaction history for NFTs\n‚úÖ CDN support for fast media retrieval\n‚úÖ Support for Ethereum mainnet, Arbitrum, and Optimism, with Polygon and Solana coming soon\n‚úÖ Today, we‚Äôre covering the bulk of standard ERC-721 and 1155 contracts, but expanding our support to bring coverage to non-standard collections and everything else rapidly\n\n** What can I use this for? **\n\nTo build exceptional NFT experiences for your users. If you are a developer building a wallet, marketplace, game, metaverse, or other web3 app, we are the easiest way to quickly and reliably query NFT data across chain. Querying blockchains directly is slow, there are many edge cases depending on the contract, and every chain has its nuances. We abstract away all that complexity, and provide a unified schema accessible from simple REST endpoints.\n\n** How can I get it? **\n\nSign up at https://app.simplehash.com to generate API Keys, and read the docs / play around with the endpoints at https://simplehash.readme.io/reference/overview. While we‚Äôre in our Developer Alpha, the API is free to use (subject to reasonable use). Longer term we‚Äôll have a usage based pricing model, so you‚Äôll only pay for what you use, along with a free tier.\n\n** Want to learn more / provide feedback? **\n\nFollow us on Twitter at https://twitter.com/SimpleHashInc - we‚Äôll be regularly posting about the fun intricacies and edge cases involved with indexing and serving up all NFT data from multiple blockchains. Also feel free to email us directly at founders@simplehash.com ‚Äî any and all feedback, questions, or requests are more than welcome ‚Äî we‚Äôd love to hear from you, and take feedback and input from our users very seriously!",

Our product lets you place garments on people instantly using only 2-D images. Mix and match different garments and shoes, and select a face that best represents you!\n\n**Common questions**\n\n1. What is the virtual try-on?\nVirtual try-on is the ability to put specific garments on digital people to see how it looks on that person.\n\n2. How should I use virtual try-on?\nWe released our API to let you explore. We found success selling to fashion retailers to improve engagement among shoppers. Small boutiques have also used us to generate model photoshoots when they do not have the resources to set up their own studio. Happy to see how we can help with your use case!\n\n3. How does the technology work?\nWe use a combination of computer vision techniques such as GANs, inpainting networks, and warping modules to generate realistic images.\n\n4. What kind of garments can I upload?\nWe require a ghost mannequin garment image or flat lay garment image to work (garment image on a neutral background). We support virtual try-on for a variety of garments, but have issues rendering cropped tops, transparent garments, lingerie, and oversized garments.\n\n5. Does the generated image provide accurate sizing?\nNo, our technology is meant to be super lightweight, so it does not take sizing into account. We use 2-D garment images and to generate onto 2-D model images. We focus on generating realistic-looking 2-D images that capture the texture, shading, folds, and drape of the garments.\n\n6. Can I upload my face and select my body type?\nWe are planning to release a face uploading feature soon! Supporting different body shapes is on our roadmap afterwards :)\n\n**Getting started**\n\nGetting started is easy. Head over to https://revery.ai and get started for free!",

Then usually I insert some emojis here and there (that's why I also made <a href=\"https://getmumu.com?ref=producthunt\" target=\"_blank\">Mumu X</a>). But there must be something else.\n\nIntroducing <a href=\"https://pointnuts.com?ref=producthunt\" target=\"_blank\">Pointnuts</a>!\n\nTwitter doesn't allow us to modify the tweet style (it's all plain), but making <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/posts/special-symbols-by-mumu-x\">special symbols on Mumu X</a> made me realize that it's possible to have a styled tweet like bold, italic, and even some other cool stuffs (but of course you should use it moderately).\n\nAnd it's free!\n\nI'm looking forward to see how you would make your tweet more engaging (feel free to @ me on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wilbertliu\" target=\"_blank\">@wilbertliu</a> üòÄ).

And when we talked to users about what we can do beyond blocking ads, the overwhelming response was for a reliable, intuitive VPN service they could trust. So over the last year, we've been hard at work building exactly that! \n\nYou might be asking yourself, what makes the AdBlock VPN different?\n\nüí∞ Affordable - We have the cheapest monthly and yearly option for a VPN on the market, and there are no gimmicks to lock you into multi year deals.\n\nüòä Intuitive - Like our browser extension, our VPN is designed with simplicity at heart so you can quickly install it, turn it on and forget about it. But if you want more advanced features and info, you can get those easily too!\n\nüîê Private - We've had a long standing policy of tracking as little data as possible and our VPN takes that even further. We don't just subscribe to a no-log policy, but we also limit all data collection on the website and app feature usage, and don't use Google Analytics.\n\nWho loves AdBlock VPN?\n\nüòª We've had a dedicated group of ~2K beta users testing our VPN for the last few months. Their feedback has helped us greatly improve the product quality and experience. Our products are for the user and we always build with your feedback in mind.\n\nWhat's next for AdBlock VPN?\n\nThis is just the starting point! We're going to continue to improve the product experience on our Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android apps. But we're planning on taking it beyond that by leveraging our ad and tracker blocking experience to expand the functionality of the VPN.\n\nPlease enjoy the AdBlock VPN and let us know what you think!\n‚ù§Ô∏è The AdBlock Team",

This can be exhausting, daunting and difficult to manage at times especially when you have a massive conveyor belt of tabs open on your browser.\n\nThe online car market is expected to grow to $723 bn (a 12% jump in 8 years according to Allied Market Research). There could be a greater emphasis on online processes for car shopping. And with a growing supply of vehicle marketplaces to choose from, car shoppers might experience information overload with few ways to consolidate and manage numerous vehicles across different sites that they might be interested in.\n\nThe Bumper.com team is very excited to announce a free Chrome extension to help alleviate that problem and we're super excited to share this with you all today!\n\nIntroducing Bumper Showroom! It‚Äôs a browser extension to help you save vehicles across the web and view them in one place. It‚Äôs built-in with additional features such as vehicle comparison, details about the specs by VIN and more!\n\nüñ±Ô∏è **One-click.** As you research for cars online, you can save them to your Showroom if we have VIN data on it with one click!\n\n‚ö° **Plug and play!** Add Showroom to your Chrome browser for free. Visit vehicle marketplace sites such as Autotrader, Carfax, Truecar, Cars.com, Carmax, and others to get started.\n\nüîÉ **Compare vehicles side by side.** You can compare up to 3 cars side by side inside your Showroom to help you comparative shop.\n\nüìù **1 free vehicle history report**. New Showroom users who create a free Bumper account can get access to a Bumper vehicle history report, we're an NMVTIS approved data provider. Helping you learn more about a vehicle's history when applicable. Existing Bumper users will continue to get unlimited vehicle history reports.\n\nWe're super excited to share this with you all! We truly hope Showroom can be a serviceable tool for online car shoppers by helping people consolidate their car research to save time and effort.  We are excited to know what you think. üöÄ\n\nCheers!\nPeter\n\nHave any feedback for us? Please feel free to let us know!\nhttps://twitter.com/bumperdotcom",

It also helps foster a sense of community with the existing users and helps with retention and customers service. \n\nWe're excited to see all the different ways Thonest is used and plan on rolling out a lot more features. We would love to know what you think! \n",

Business-logic testing(negative test-cases)\n3. Security testing\n\nWhy ApiHome?\n- Easier to navigate UI\n- To the point Spec validation errors let you get documentation out of the way \n\nUpcoming Features:\n- Code repository crawler to discover API assets\n- More fuzzing rules & examples to fix validation errors quickly\n- CI/CD integration\n\nApiHome is in Beta and is free to use!\nI would love for you guys to give it a shot and share feedback.\n\nThank you\nShashank",

Being a chrome extension I see it as a big limiting factor.\n\nAnyway, best of luck guys! Hope you find a solution to both problems!",
